The band already has a couple of prior releases attached to them: a 6-song EP released in 2013 called 'Kaleidoscope', and a 2-track recorded in Brooklyn, New York called 'Nobody's Gonna Wait'.",

Deacon was recruited in February 1971, before the band released their debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, Queen II, in 1974. Sheer Heart Attack later that year and A Night at the Opera in 1975 brought them international success.
